            Extension by @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}


            You can update the extension on this "Pull Request" by commenting the update command:
            in the comment field, type `!update`, then drag and drop a zip file with your extension file in the 
            commenting field, like how you initially submitted the extension. It should look like this:


            ```

            !update [MyExtension.zip](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions/files/12709661/MyExtension.zip)
            
            ```


            It can take a few seconds for the file to fully upload and show as the above. Once it is like shown above,
            click "Comment" and let the bot do the rest!

Community submissions are not reviewed by default, so your extension should be added once we've checked that your submission doesn't contain malicious code without further intervention on your part. If you wish for your extension to be reviewed (and thereby moved to the list of reviewed extensions), please follow the instructions written on the [README](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions#get-your-extension-reviewed-extensions). Thanks again for your contribution to GDevelop!"
