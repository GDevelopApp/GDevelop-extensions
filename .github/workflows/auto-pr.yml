[You can see the progress of your submission on this page](${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}). Community submissions are not reviewed by default, so your extension should be added once we've checked that your submission doesn't contain malicious code without further intervention on your part. If you wish for your extension to be reviewed (and thereby moved to the list of reviewed extensions), please follow the instructions written on the [README](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions#get-your-extension-reviewed-extensions). Thanks again for your contribution to GDevelop!"
