  "description": "This extension adds conditions to check if an object is located within the visible portion of its layer's camera. The condition also allows for specifying padding to the virtual screen border.\n\nAs each layer has a unique camera, this will only work for the layer that the object is on. This does not take into account any object visibility, such as being hidden or 0 opacity, but can be combined with those existing conditions.\n\nThis uses the object's boundary box for detection, due to this objects with modified origin points may not behave as expected.",
