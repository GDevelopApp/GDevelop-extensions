## Submit your extension

If you've created an extension with GDevelop, you can submit it to be shared with the rest of the community. This [Trello board has the extensions that are being worked on](https://trello.com/b/AftjL2v1/gdevelop-extensions) by the community.

1. **Create your extension** in your game with GDevelop: see the documentation about [functions](http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/events/functions) and [custom behaviors](http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/behaviors/events-based-behaviors).
2. Make sure the **descriptions**, **tags**, **names** are properly filled in the options of the extension. Check that you have followed all **[the best practices that are listed here](http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/extensions/best-practices)**.
3. **Export** your extension to a _.json file_ from GDevelop.
4. Submit it! You can either:
   - **Easy**: [submit it here](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop-extensions/issues/new/choose), attaching the _.json file_ (as a zip, because GitHub won't accept json files directly).
   - **Faster to review**: fork this repository, clone the git, add your .json file in `Extensions` folder. Finally [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop-extensions/compare). Deployment is done automatically when pushed to `main` branch: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions/tree/main)
